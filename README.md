# **The Digital Perpetual Energy Machine**  
**A recursive energy regeneration system that mimics perpetual energy flow in digital space.**

---

## **Overview**  
The **Digital Perpetual Energy Machine** is a groundbreaking simulation that combines geometric structures, energy dynamics, and fractal space to produce a **self-sustaining digital energy loop**. Inspired by real-world particle accelerators and emergent systems, this model demonstrates how energy can flow, decay, and regenerate recursively.

### **Key Features**  
1. **Sphere-Pyramid-Fractal Energy System**  
   - Agents begin with energy in a *Sphere*.  
   - They lose energy as they traverse and collapse within a *Pyramid*.  
   - Collapsed agents enter *Fractal Space* for energy regeneration and stabilization.  
   - Regenerated agents re-enter the system, creating a **perpetual energy loop**.

2. **Energy & Entropy Tracking**  
   - Total system energy and entropy are measured over multiple feedback cycles.  
   - Metrics include collapsed agents, regenerated agents, and emergent clusters.

3. **Dynamic Visualizations**  
   - 3D plots display agents' paths, collapses, and energy recharge cycles.  
   - Metrics are logged for analysis of recursive energy dynamics.

## **How It Works**  

The Digital Perpetual Energy Machine is a **closed-loop system**:
1. **Sphere**: Agents begin with initial energy, uniformly distributed in 3D space.  
2. **Pyramid**:  
   - Agents descend and interact within a pyramid structure.  
   - Energy is lost, dispersing as entropy into the system.  
   - Agents collapse when their energy falls below a defined threshold.  
3. **Fractal Space**:  
   - Collapsed agents enter fractal space, where they regenerate energy.  
   - Energy is restored based on **fractal dimension dynamics** and spatial transformations.  
4. **Recursive Feedback Loop**:  
   - Recharged agents re-enter the sphere with stabilized energy, perpetuating the system.
